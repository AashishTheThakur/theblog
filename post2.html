            The iPad Air now gets the more versatile USB-C. You can get a cheap non-Apple USB-C hub and connect external display, microSD card, USB devices such as microphones, external storage and more.

Battery life is great. I got around 9hr+ of battery life using it at home. You can expect shorter battery life if you use this outdoors under bright conditions as the auto-brightness will max out the brightness.

Battery charging speed is quite slow though so it's best to charge it overnight. The 20W charger included is not considered a fast charger.

There are four sets of speaker grills but audio only comes out from two, the bottom two when the tablet is in landscape format. Audio quality is loud and clear.

One slight difference between the iPad Air 4 and iPad Pro 11 is the screen size which is 10.9-inch vs 11-inch and the resolution 2360 x 1640 and 2388 x 1668.

iPad Air 4 has 28 pixels fewer from the length and width.

Physical dimensions is 247.6 x 178.5 x 6.1mm vs 247.6 x 178.5 x 5.9mm. The iPad Pro 11 is 0.2mm thinner. iPad Air 4 (wifi) weighs 458g, 13g lighter.

Specifications
The processor has been upgraded to the A14 chip and there is 4GB of RAM. In real world, there's no speed difference between the iPad Air 4 and iPad Pro 2018, or even the iPad Air 3 (2019).

The new processor is not going to make you draw better or faster. The iPad Air 2018 by today's standard is still an incredibly powerful tablet.
The main selling points for the iPad Air 4 are the laminated display and compact design that makes it so portable, and it's cheaper than the iPad Pro. Without the fingerprint sensor from the previous model, the bezels can now be shrunk so effectively you are getting a larger display (up for 10.5inch) in a smaller body with the same fantastic battery life.

The tablet is relatively lightweight and even with a case, using with one hand doesn't get too tiring that easily. The lighter weight allows you to stand and sketch while holding the tablet in one hand.
I go it down to 12.8GB after uninstalling unwanted apps and installing all the apps I use and importing some files over, I used around 25GB, which means I'm only left with 39GB of storage left.

64GB for drawing should be sufficient. The upgrade to 256GB is an extra US $150 (SGD $220).

The alternative to getting more storage is to get the 200GB iCloud plan which cost US $3 per month. With the $150 you saved from not upgrading, you can get at least 4 years worth of iCloud.

iCloud serves two functions, as a backup and as online storage. You will probably want to get iCloud anyway since it provides online backup for your iPad and the 50GB plan (US $1/month) is certainly not enough to backup a 64GB tablet.

Downside to getting the 64GB model and 200GB iCloud is when you run out of space on the iPad Air, you have to manually transfer the files over to iCloud. It's a minor inconvenience unless you churn out 20-30GB worth of files often.
